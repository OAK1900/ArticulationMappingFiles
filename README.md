## Articulation Mapping files 

Following files format supporting.

- Cubase / Nuendo
    - VST Expression map (*.expressionmap)
- Studio One 5
    - Key Switch file (*.keyswitch)
        - I use my own tool to perform automatic conversions from VST expression maps; some files that use MIDI CC may not be supported.

## For Studio One 5 Users

You will probably have the following folder, so put the file down after you download it.

- Windows: `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Documents\Studio One\Presets\User Presets\Key Switches`
- Mac: `/Users/<USERNAME>/Documents/Studio One/Presets/User Presets\Key Switches`

If the file is not recognized, double-click on the file in Explorer or Finder with your DAW open. (This has been confirmed by Studio One 5 for Windows)

## These files are...

- Made by myself
- Mirror of official files (see **NOTICE** file)
- Mirror of other user file(s) that currently cannot download from their site (see **NOTICE** file)

## Easy file format conversion between DAWs

I developed converting tool.
